# percipio-axios-example

Demonstrates using the [Percipio Axios Client with SDK](https://github.com/martinholden-skillsoft/percipio-axios/tree/sdk) to call a Percipio API method. The example code calls the [User Management API getUsers method](https://api.percipio.com/user-management/api-docs/#/%2Fv1/getUsers).

As the [Percipio Axios Client with SDK](https://github.com/martinholden-skillsoft/percipio-axios/tree/sdk) is not published to NPMJS, it is loaded from the GitHub repo.

It also illustrates concepts such as passing a custom Axios Instance during creation of the client, the example Axios instance is extended with interceptors to add timing data and a correlation id.

To use this code you will need:

1. A Skillsoft [Percipio](https://www.skillsoft.com/meet-skillsoft-percipio) Site
1. A [Percipio Service Account](https://documentation.skillsoft.com/en_us/pes/Integration/int_api_rest_authentication.htm#Authorization)
