# percipio-axios-example

Demonstrates using the [Percipio Axios Client](https://github.com/martinholden-skillsoft/percipio-axios) to call a Percipio API method. The example code calls the [Common API getCollections method](https://api.percipio.com/common/api-docs/#/%2Fv1/getCollections).

As the [Percipio Axios Client](https://github.com/martinholden-skillsoft/percipio-axios) is not published to NPMJS, it is loaded from the GitHub repo.

It also illustrates concepts such as passing a custom Axios Instance during creation of the client, the example Axios instance is extended with interceptors to add timing data and a correlation id. It also shows how the replacement of placeholders in the resource path work.

To use this code you will need:

1. A Skillsoft [Percipio](https://www.skillsoft.com/platform-solution/percipio/) Site
1. A [Percipio Service Account](https://documentation.skillsoft.com/en_us/pes/Integration/int_api_rest_authentication.htm#Authorization)
